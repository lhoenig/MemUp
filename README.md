* Setup key-based ssh authentication between build host and iOS device for automatic installation of package  
* Hit `Cmd-Shift-I`

### If you just want to install:
* Use the provided package and on the iOS device, run  
`$ sudo dpkg -i com.rub1k.MemUp_1.0-1_iphoneos-arm.deb; killall SpringBoard`  
* And of course you have to make it visible in NC by putting it in the list of displayed widgets in Preferences -> Notifications.
